# Task Manager RESTFul-API

Task manager application built using **NODE JS** and **MongoDB**. It follows a **RESTFul API** design architecture. The app sends an email notification upon registration and deactivation of the user's account. It's richly built with a simple scientific technique and best practices in the world of **API** design. The incoming data is validated for both users and tasks using a third party library called Joi. The api is using JWT authentication where it generates a JWT token and sends to the client on first login and then the client must provide JWT token in the Authorization header in every request made by the client.

## Features

- Sending Emails
- Authentication and Security
